# Smart-Face-Lock-System
The code is developed to perform the face recognition on captured frame and recognize if the person face matches to one of the saved faces. The code than trigger the IO pins to rotate the thumb turn and unlock the door.


To run the code, OpenCV and Dlib Libraries are required. The Pi camera must be enabled and at least one person's dataset must be present inside the dataset folder. To start the code, open the FaceRecognitionMain file and run it.
